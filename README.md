## Reflection

This was a personal project built in order to have a personal portfolio to show my work to the world while also having a good user experience.

The main programming language being used is TypeScript, and the technologies used to build the project are React, Sass and Material UI.

The project also counts with a GitHub workflow that automatically deploys the built application using Github Pages whenever a new pull-request is opened to a release branch.
